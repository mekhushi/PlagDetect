# 🚨 PlagDetectCPP



**PlagDetectCPP** is a blazing-fast, reliable command-line plagiarism detection tool written in C++. It helps educators, developers, and reviewers 🔍 detect copied or duplicated code segments across source files, ensuring code originality and maintaining academic or project integrity.

## ❗ Problem Statement

In academic and professional environments, ensuring the originality of source code is critical. Traditional plagiarism detection methods relying on exact text matching often fail when code is modified superficially — like changing variable names, reformatting, or rearranging code blocks. This leads to undetected plagiarism and compromises integrity.

**PlagDetectCPP** addresses this by analyzing the structural and syntactic patterns in code, enabling detection of cleverly disguised plagiarism and code duplication across multiple files and projects efficiently and accurately.

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 **Syntax-aware comparison:** Goes beyond simple text matching by analyzing code structure  
- 🧩 **Multi-language support:** Easily customizable to work with various programming languages  
- 🎯 **Adjustable sensitivity:** Set similarity thresholds to control detection strictness  
- 📊 **Detailed reports:** Highlights exact matching code segments with clear visualization  
- ⚡ **High performance:** Lightweight and optimized for large codebases and batch processing  
- 🛠️ **Minimal dependencies:** Simple setup with no heavy external libraries required

## 🛠️ Installation

Get started quickly by cloning and building the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PlagDetectCPP.git
cd PlagDetectCPP
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
----
### 🚀 Usage
Run the tool easily from the command line:
```bash
./plagdetectcpp -d <directory_or_file_path> -t <similarity_threshold>
```

---
### 🔍 How It Works
PlagDetectCPP parses source code to understand syntax and structure rather than comparing plain text. This allows it to detect plagiarism even if variable names, whitespace, or formatting have been altered — making it a powerful tool against disguised code copying.
